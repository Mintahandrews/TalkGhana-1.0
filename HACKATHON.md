Our solution provides voice-to-text transcription, text-to-speech synthesis, and WhatsApp integration for Ghanaian languages, making digital communication more accessible to all.

## 🌍 The Problem

Ghana is home to over 80 languages, with many citizens more comfortable communicating in their native tongue than in English. This creates significant barriers in:

- **Digital Access**: Most technology solutions assume English literacy
- **Education**: Learning materials are primarily in English

1. **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken Ghanaian languages to text
2. **Text-to-Speech**: Generates natural-sounding speech in Ghanaian languages

4. **Phrase Bank**: Stores common phrases for quick access and reuse
